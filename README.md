Exercises from the Go tour tutorial: https://tour.golang.org/

### To make things work on local machine:
- Take this link as reference: https://golang.org/doc/code.html
- Install the golang (any version). On Ubuntu, use sudo apt install golang
- Import the code inside the local go workspace
- for each exercise, try $go install github.com/clertonraf/exercise-errors
- if the compiled code is in bon folder, just call it through its name (without extensions)
